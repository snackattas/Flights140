</br></br>
<ul>
    <li>Keeping the domain name</li>
    <li><a href="https://www.heroku.com" style="cursor:pointer;">Heroku</a> server uptime</li>
    <li><a href="https://www.twilio.com/" style="cursor:pointer;">Twilio</a> for texts</li>
    <li><a href="https://www.sendgrid.com/" style="cursor:pointer;">Sendgrid</a> for emails</li>
    <li>Time spent creating and maintaining the website</li>
</ul>

Donations are greatly appreciated.  Recommended donation is $3, the cost of a cup o' joe these days.  If you've found a deal using Flights140, donating would be a great way of saying thanks!
